        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          That day, I was so nervous when my man asked me out for an ice cream date. I wasn’t sure what to expect, and my heart was racing with excitement and a little fear. I sat in the back seat, feeling a little shy and not completely comfortable yet, while he drove us to Sweet Cream, our favorite ice cream spot. For an hour and a half, we shared laughs, stories, and our favorite flavors of ice cream. The world outside seemed to disappear, leaving just the two of us in our little cozy bubble. Even though I was scared at first, it turned out to be such a sweet and unforgettable day. We talked, teased each other, and enjoyed every bite of our ice cream, creating a memory that still makes me smile whenever I think about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back now, after we are nikkahfied, that little ice cream date feels even more special. It was the start of our journey together, a moment that grew into the love and trust we share today. That shy, nervous girl in the back seat has now found comfort, happiness, and a lifelong partner in him.
