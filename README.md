# Our First Date (Before Marriage)

A simple, elegant, and fully responsive webpage built with **HTML5** and **CSS3 only** (no JavaScript, no frameworks).  
It shares a short story about our best pre‑marriage ice cream date at **Sweet Cream** and includes a CSS Grid photo gallery featuring **the same couple** for visual consistency.

## How to run locally
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Make sure your images are placed in `assets/images/` with the exact filenames above.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
   - **Optionally:** Use VS Code Live Server for live reload while editing.

## Gallery & Captions
- Gallery 1: Sitting together with love  
- Gallery 2: Holding Hands  
- Gallery 3: Lost in each other’s eyes  
- Gallery 4: Quick Selfie  
- Gallery 5: Loving Look  
- Gallery 6: Sweet Moments  

_All images have descriptive `alt` text for accessibility._

## Accessibility & Design
- Mobile‑first layout, scales gracefully up to large screens (320px → 1200px).  
- CSS Grid gallery with responsive columns: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(180px, 1fr))`.  
- One Google Font (Lora), no inline styles.  
- Color palette uses soft backgrounds, readable text, and romantic accents (aims for WCAG AA).  

## AI Usage
This project used AI assistance for ideation and text drafting:  
- ChatGPT helped draft the story, gallery captions, and this README.md.  
- All final HTML, CSS, and images were curated and edited manually in VS Code.  

*(GitHub Copilot was not used in this project.)*

## GitHub Pages
After pushing to GitHub (public repo, default branch `main`), enable Pages:  
**Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: `main` / `root`**.

Your live URL will look like:  
```

https\://<your-username>.github.io/best-date-website/

```
Add that URL here once live.

## Reflection
- I learned how to build a fully responsive webpage using only HTML and CSS.  
- The trickiest part was making the gallery and story section look visually consistent across devices.  
- Next time, I’d add a favicon and refine typography and color accents for an even more polished look.
